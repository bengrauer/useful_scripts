# useful_scripts
This project is where I place useful scripts for quick access and display.  At this time, this project will only contain scripts that I have created myself.

## sql
Directory for any handy SQL scripts.  Currently contains one Impala script w/ regular expressions to generically profile and categorize the data found in any given column.  Used to get a high level view of all different types of data contained within a column or set of columns.  Great for determinig what type of data you have.
